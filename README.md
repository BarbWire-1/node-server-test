### This is just a test thing. Only shared for debugging purposes.


Thankful for any criticism, input, suggestion.
Many parts are not fully implemented, all not refactored - but working in postman on localhost/3000
Internal calls on the server from index.js working now, but throwing for sending data (still applies!)
I need to trace the dataFlow and find a nicer way to trigger a "fakeRequest"

If it's just a stupid idea or totally weird, let me know :)
